# Arkansas prison scraper

Arkansas prison scraper is a web scraper that iterates through all the incarcerated people listed by [Arkansas Department of Corrections](https://apps.ark.org/inmate_info/index.php). The script searches for incarcerated people by age from 10 to 110. The program generates a seperate csv file for each age with each row containing information on a seperate incarcerated person. The script then concatenates all the csv files into a single csv file.

I created this script to gain a better understanding Arkansas's incarcertaion program. When I started this project in March of 2022, ADoC didn't have a readily available, free, comprehensive and up to date database with the information of all incarcerated people in the state. At the same time, the state was expanding its prison system.
